## 💡 About The Project

**AritAI** is a modern, unified AI workspace built for developers and power users.

Instead of being locked into a single AI provider, AritAI leverages the **OpenRouter API** to give you access to the world's best models—**GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, and Mistral**—all inside one beautiful, responsive interface powered by **Tailwind CSS v4**.

---

## ❓ The Problem Statement

**Why is the current AI experience frustrating for developers?**

1.  **Subscription Fatigue:** To get the best results, you often need ChatGPT Plus ($20), Claude Pro ($20), and others. It gets expensive fast.
2.  **Model Silos:** You are stuck in one ecosystem. If GPT-4 refuses a coding task that Claude handles well, you have to switch apps and copy-paste context.
3.  **Limited Control:** Standard chat interfaces don't let developers tweak parameters (temperature, tokens) or easily swap models mid-conversation.
4.  **Bloated UIs:** Many AI tools are cluttered. Developers need a clean, "Zen mode" interface that handles code blocks and file uploads efficiently.
